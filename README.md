# rockpaperscissors

**rockpaperscissors** is a is a [true object-oriented](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html)
implementation of the famous [Rock, Paper and Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) game.


## What does *true object-oriented* means?

This application follows these four fundamental principles:

 1. not a single `null` ([why NULL is bad?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/13/why-null-is-bad.html))
 2. not a single `public` `static` method ([why they are bad?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html))
 3. not a single mutable class ([why they are bad?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html))
 4. not a single `instanceof` keyword, type casting, or reflection ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/02/class-casting-is-anti-pattern.html))

If you want to know more about true object-oriented programming, I recommend
